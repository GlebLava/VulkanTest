# GLFW
Download the latest GLFW library. https://www.glfw.org/. Copy the include folder to your own project. 
Under the properties of the project it needs to be included and also linked to the folder containing the lib files.

# GLM 
Since GLM is a header-only library, just download the latest version https://github.com/g-truc/glm/releases and store it somewhere in the project. This one needs to be included as well but not linked. 

# Vulkan
Download latest Vulkan SDK here https://vulkan.lunarg.com/ and install it. 
The location vulkan was installed to has an include folder as well, wich needs to be included into the project as well as the lib folder which needs to be linked to.
